# recall

Ever lost a conversation session with Claude Code or Codex and wish you could resume it? This skill lets Claude and your agents search across all your past conversations with full-text search. Builds a SQLite FTS5 index over `~/.claude/projects/` and `~/.codex/sessions/` with BM25 ranking, Porter stemming, and incremental updates.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add arjunkmrm/recall
```

Then use `/recall` in Claude Code (or Codex) or ask "find a past session where we talked about foo" (you might need to restart Claude Code).

## How it works

- Indexes user/assistant messages from both `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (Claude Code) and `~/.codex/sessions/` (Codex) into a SQLite FTS5 database at `~/.recall.db`
- First run indexes all sessions (a few seconds); subsequent runs only process new/modified files
- Skips tool_use, tool_result, thinking, and image blocks
- Returns results ranked by BM25 with highlighted excerpts, tagged `[claude]` or `[codex]`
- No dependencies — Python 3.9+ stdlib only (sqlite3, json, argparse)
